# Food and Time Cost
# Overview
This project was conducted for Practice and Application of Data Science (DSC 80) at UCSD. It aims to further insight into how significant the time cost of a recipe is to people's perception of recipes and/or cooking.
# Introduction
Recipes are an important tool for any cook, whether it's for needing a step-by-step guide on a dish, learning the basics through a guide, and so much more. The taste and overall satisfaction from the resulting product of a recipe would be an average person's metrics for evaluating how good a recipe is.

But what metrics would those who may not have the luxury of slow-cooking and the time to follow finely-detailed instructions use to rate a recipe? College students may be the perfect example of this category of people. The pressure and time constraints of homework, studies, employment or internships, and other activities, academia-related or not, are just some of the items that may make up a student's daily life.

In recent times, the concept of "meal-prep" has become widespread with the help of social media. Creating food in large quantities in a single day, then portioning that food throughout the week has become a common way for some to take care of their meals.

As more people begin to embrace this method of efficient cooking, one might wonder **if the time cost of a recipe influences one's rating of the recipe.**
